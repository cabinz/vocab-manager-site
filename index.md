# Welcome to the official site of Vocab Manager ðŸ˜€

Vocab Manager is an open-source project developing a Windows desktop notebook software. It enables users to freely customize their own vocabulary and do self-testing on it.

The product is suitable for foreign language learners who are used to remember vocabulary through context, example, definition, some extra notes and usually do foreign language reading on computer. It aims to provide users a clean and regular pattern of remembering and reviewing words and phrases. 

**The latest major version of Vocab Manager is [1.x](./v1_intro.html), go check it out!**

# Ideas and Development

The idea of Vocab Manager is from my daily study of English, where I often read text books, papers, watch videos on computer, frustrating about having no proper software to note down and manage the new words I learned.

Out of these requirements, I programmed a demo of Vocab Manager in Delphi as my database system course project in spring, 2021. And it was refactored to be a completed .NET WinForm application in the summer of the same year.

In the future, I'm about to improve the user interface by rebuilding the GUI code with WPF. And maybe it will be rebuilt from scratch using other framework to support crossing platform some days.

# Open Source
