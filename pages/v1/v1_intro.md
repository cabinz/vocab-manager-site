Vocab Manager 1.x is a Windows WinForm desktop notebook software, enabling users to freely customize their own vocabulary and do self-testing on it.

The product is suitable for foreign language learners who are used to remember vocabulary through context, example, definition, some extra notes and usually do foreign language reading on computer.

Vocab Manager 1.x is based on .NET Framework, using SQLite as local storage, supporting vocabulary manipulating, tagging, searching, quizzing and report/note generating.
